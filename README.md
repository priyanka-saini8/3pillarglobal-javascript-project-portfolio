# 3PillarGlobal-JavaScript-Project-Portfolio
Internship Mini Project (Completed)<br>
This project is hosted live [here](http://priyankasaini.rf.gd/3pillarglobal/portfolio-mini-project/)

## Task
I was assigned a task to create a Mini Project named Portfolio that looks similar to the one shown on this link [here](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/27_Day_Mini_project_portfolio/27_day_mini_project_portfolio.md).

## Key Features
- I have used basic JavaScript to provide Animations in this project.
- Used Media Queries to make the site responsive.

### The Page is Responsive
I have used Media Queries along with some CSS to make the site responsive so that it looks good on small screens(like Mobile Phones)<br>
